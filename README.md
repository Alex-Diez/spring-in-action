# Spring-in-Action

I decided to get acquainted with latest trends in the [Spring Framework](http://spring.io) with the help of the [Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fifth-edition) book.

Hope I will learn not only Spring as a framework but how to test it and design my domain in proper way of using Spring.
